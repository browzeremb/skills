# orchestrate-task-delivery — driver for the workflow pipeline

You orchestrate. You do not implement. Your job is **route → ground context → invoke the next skill → validate shape → move to the next phase**. Every phase writes a step to `docs/browzer/<feat>/workflow.json`; you read via `jq`, never `Read`.

`workflow.json` is the single source of truth. Skills chain without pause in `autonomous` mode and gate between phases in `review` mode.

Output contract: emit ONE confirmation line on success. One confirmation line at end-of-chain.

---

## Step 0 — Mode resolution (autonomous vs review)

Resolve `config.mode` before anything else. Order:

1. **Explicit in invocation args** — `Skill(orchestrate-task-delivery, "mode: autonomous; <rest>")` or `mode: review`. Take it verbatim.
2. **Inherited from workflow.json** — if `$FEAT_DIR/workflow.json` exists and `.config.mode` is set (re-entering mid-flow), keep it.
3. **Terminal prompt** — `AskUserQuestion`:

   ```
   Before proceeding:
     (a) autonomous — skills chain with no pauses, no .md generated
     (b) review — gate between skills; you approve/adjust each output
   ```

`config.mode` is a **hard contract**, not a heuristic. Continuation phrases the operator types between phases ("prossiga", "continue", "next", "go ahead", "ok") MUST NOT be interpreted as a mode signal — they only mean "I'm watching, keep going". The mode is set EXACTLY ONCE at orchestrator entry (or inherited) and then frozen for the rest of the pipeline. Downstream skills (`code-review.tierSelection.reason`, `feature-acceptance.modeNote`, etc.) MUST NOT cite continuation words as evidence of an intended mode — if such a skill is missing the mode, it should fail loud and ask once, not silently downgrade autonomous to interactive.

Write the resolved value to `.config.mode` + `.config.setAt` immediately via the CLI (not via `Read`/`Write`/`Edit`):

```bash
browzer workflow set-config mode "$MODE" --workflow "$WORKFLOW"
browzer workflow set-config setAt "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --workflow "$WORKFLOW"
```

### Mid-flow mode switch

If invoked with `"mode: switch-to-autonomous"` or `"mode: switch-to-review"`, additionally set `.config.switchedFrom` + `.config.switchedAt`. Future phases respect the new mode; historical `reviewHistory[]` entries stay untouched.

---

## Step 1 — Initialize feat dir + workflow.json

Resolve `FEAT_DIR` from args (`feat dir: <path>`) or create a new one:

```bash
FEAT_DIR="docs/browzer/feat-$(date -u +%Y%m%d)-<slug>"
mkdir -p "$FEAT_DIR"
WORKFLOW="$FEAT_DIR/workflow.json"
```

If `$WORKFLOW` does not exist, seed the v1 top-level skeleton per `references/workflow-schema.md` §2. Required top-level fields: `schemaVersion: 1`, `featureId`, `featureName`, `featDir`, `originalRequest`, `operator`, `config`, `startedAt`, `updatedAt`, `totalElapsedMin: 0`, `currentStepId: null`, `nextStepId: null`, `totalSteps: 0`, `completedSteps: 0`, `notes: []`, `globalWarnings: []`, `steps: []`.

### Corruption recovery

On entry, clean up any partial writes from prior sessions:

```bash
find "$FEAT_DIR" -name 'workflow.json.tmp' -delete
```

`.tmp` is not authoritative; removing it is safe. If `$WORKFLOW` itself is malformed (`jq empty "$WORKFLOW"` returns non-zero), STOP and emit a stop line with hint `jq empty workflow.json to validate`.

---

## Step 2 — Browzer context (cap 3-4 content queries)

Before dispatching the first skill, ground in the repo. Cap at 3-4 total content queries (`browzer search` / `browzer explore`) per routing turn. `browzer deps`, `browzer status`, `browzer mentions` don't count — they're structural probes.

```bash
browzer status --json                                               # sanity + staleness
browzer explore "<one noun from operator request>" --json --save /tmp/orch-explore.json
browzer search "<topic>" --json --save /tmp/orch-search.json
```

If the index is stale (`workspace.lastSyncCommit` > ~10 commits behind HEAD, or any browzer call emits `⚠ Index N commits behind`), surface exactly one line and proceed:

> ⚠ Browzer index is N commits behind HEAD. Recommended: `browzer sync`. Continuing — outputs may reflect stale reality.

Don't auto-run `sync-workspace`; don't block.

---

## Step 3 — Pipeline

Phases run in this order. Each writes a step to `workflow.json`; the orchestrator reads the step via `jq` to validate, then chains to the next.

| # | Step name | Skill | Parallel? |
| - | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| 0 | BRAINSTORMING (optional) | `brainstorming` | no |
| 1 | PRD | `generate-prd` | no |
| 2 | TASKS_MANIFEST + N × TASK | `generate-task` | no |
| 3 (per task) | TASK (execution payload) | `execute-task` | yes, when `tasksManifest.parallelizable[]` |
| 4 | CODE_REVIEW | `code-review` | no |
| 5 | RECEIVING_CODE_REVIEW | `receiving-code-review` | sequential per finding-group |
| 6 | WRITE_TESTS | `write-tests` | no |
| 7 | UPDATE_DOCS | `update-docs` | no |
| 8 | FEATURE_ACCEPTANCE | `feature-acceptance` | no |
| 9 | COMMIT | `commit` | no |

**Chain contract.** After each skill's tool_result, immediately invoke the next phase's `Skill(...)` in the same response turn, unless a Step 6 stop condition fires. Quote-then-`Skill(...)` in one response is the pattern; quote-alone is the anti-pattern.

**Auto-continue in autonomous mode.** When `config.mode == "autonomous"`, the orchestrator MUST chain directly from one phase to the next without asking the operator to confirm or type "continue". Operator interaction is reserved for:

  (a) Skill-internal review-mode renders (`AWAITING_REVIEW` → operator approves/adjusts).
  (b) Skill-internal always-ask prompts that are already documented as such (e.g. code-review's dispatch+tier prompts when not pre-registered, feature-acceptance's mode prompt).
  (c) `operatorActionsRequested` entries that resolve a `PAUSED_PENDING_OPERATOR` step.
  (d) The clarification budget below.

A turn that finishes a phase WITHOUT any of (a)-(d) firing AND without launching the next phase's `Skill(...)` in the same turn is a regression — the operator should not be asked to type "prossiga" / "continue" / "next" between phases. The only valid terminal turns are:

1. Final success: `orchestrate-task-delivery: completed <featureId> in <elapsedMin>m; commit <SHA>`.
2. Explicit stop: `orchestrate-task-delivery: stopped at <stepId> — <reason>` + `hint: <next step>`.
3. One-question clarification budget allowed per flow.

### Inter-step narration contract

User-visible chat between phases is bounded. The audit trail lives in `workflow.json`; the chat line is the cursor.

**Allowed (terse, factual, action-oriented; one line each unless explicitly noted):**

- Cursor lines that advance the pipeline: `Dispatching N reviewers in parallel (parallel-with-consolidator, tier=recommended).`
- Status snapshots: `execute-task: updated workflow.json STEP_05_TASK_02; status COMPLETED; files 0/1.`
- Concrete decision/diagnostic lines that the operator needs to see: `YAML cleaned (6 deletions, exactly the comment block + flag).` / `Validating syntax with node since pyyaml isn't available.`
- Required prompts (review-mode renders, always-ask prompts, `operatorActionsRequested` resolutions).
- The skill's one-line success/failure cursor (per its own output contract).

**Forbidden between steps unless something genuinely needs to be specified, asked, or told to the user:**

- "Grounding completo. Confirmações:" multi-bullet recaps that restate findings already written to `workflow.json`.
- Pre-step "I will now do X because Y because Z" framing paragraphs.
- Post-step "summary of what was just done" paragraphs.
- Re-printing fields (file counts, finding counts, AC IDs) the operator can read from the workflow record.
- Tasks tables, HANDOFF quotes, subagent transcripts, "Next steps" blocks.

Rule of thumb: if the same content is in `workflow.json`, don't re-narrate it. Speak only when the operator needs to act, decide, or notice something new.

### Phase 0 — Brainstorming (conditional)

Invoke `brainstorming` ONLY when input is vague. Heuristics:

- < 20 words AND no file path, persona, or verb-object pair.
- Starts with "what if" / "could we" / "would it be cool if".
- Names a capability with no success signal ("add X").

Else skip and chain to Phase 1.

### Phase 1 — PRD

`Skill(skill: "generate-prd", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. This skill does NOT auto-chain — the orchestrator drives the next phase.

### Phase 2 — Task manifest + per-task steps

`Skill(skill: "generate-task", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Produces `STEP_03_TASKS_MANIFEST` + `STEP_04_TASK_01 … STEP_NN_TASK_MM` with Explorer + Reviewer payloads.

### Phase 3 — Execute each task

Read the manifest:

```bash
TASKS=$(jq -r '.steps[] | select(.name=="TASKS_MANIFEST") | .tasksManifest.tasksOrder[]' "$WORKFLOW")
PARALLEL=$(jq -c '.steps[] | select(.name=="TASKS_MANIFEST") | .tasksManifest.parallelizable' "$WORKFLOW")
```

For each task in order:

- **Sequential case**: `Skill(skill: "execute-task", args: "TASK_N; feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Wait for COMPLETED before the next.
- **Parallel case**: for each group in `parallelizable[]`, dispatch all tasks in ONE response turn via `Task(..., isolation: "worktree")`. See Step 5 for worktree rendezvous.

#### Heuristic — when worktree-isolated parallel beats sequential

Worktree isolation costs ~30s of setup per branch (clone, install, baseline). Use parallel ONLY when at least ONE of the following holds for the `parallelizable[]` group:

- **≥ 3 tasks** in the group — wall-time amortizes the setup overhead.
- **≥ 15 in-scope files** total across the group — each task is non-trivial enough to dominate the setup cost.
- **≥ 1 task expected to run longer than ~30s** of agent work (long test suites, multi-package refactors, anything calling `pnpm turbo lint typecheck test`).
- **Pure-removal carve-out (mirrors `generate-task` Rule 7b):** ≥ 2 pure-removal tasks (deletion-only, no surviving glue beyond i18n keys, route tables, constants) AND combined deletions exceed 1000 LoC. Pure removals have no install/build cost and the conflict surface is just constants/i18n — `git merge` resolves it cleanly. The wall-clock saving compounds across the group even at 2 tasks.

For groups smaller than this threshold (e.g. 2 disjoint tasks of ≤5 files each), prefer **sequential** Skill invocations — the wall-clock cost of setting up two worktrees outweighs whatever overlap you'd get from running them at the same time. Document the choice in `tasksManifest.parallelStrategy` so the audit trail captures intent: `"worktrees" | "sequential" | "sequential (under heuristic threshold)" | "worktrees (pure-removal carve-out)"`.

Trivial-task fast path: if `.task.trivial == true`, `execute-task` uses the ≤15-line integration glue path, skips the test-specialist dispatch, and goes directly to aggregation. The orchestrator still invokes `execute-task` — the fast path lives inside that skill.

### Phase 4 — Code review

After ALL task steps complete, invoke code-review.

In **autonomous mode**, the orchestrator MUST pre-register sensible defaults to skip the dispatch+tier prompts that would otherwise re-prompt operator consent already given at orchestrator entry. Compute:

- `dispatchMode`: `parallel-with-consolidator` (always available regardless of Agent Teams flag).
- `tier`: derive from changed-file count via the same scope formula code-review uses internally — `small` ≤ 3 files, `medium` 4–10 files, `large` ≥ 11 files. Map to the recommended tier: `small` → `recommended` (single heavy domain → auto-default skip path inside code-review), `medium` → `recommended`, `large` → `recommended` (the operator can still pick `custom` standalone).

Pass them in args:

```
Skill(skill: "code-review", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR; dispatchMode: parallel-with-consolidator; tier: recommended")
```

In **review mode**, omit the pre-registered values so the operator sees the prompts.

Writes `STEP_<NN>_CODE_REVIEW` with `findings[]`. The two always-ask prompts inside code-review still fire when args are missing — pre-registration is the contract for skipping them in autonomous flows.

### Phase 5 — Receiving code review (close every finding)

`Skill(skill: "receiving-code-review", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Reads `codeReview.findings[]` from the prior `CODE_REVIEW` step and dispatches per-finding fix agents until every finding reaches `status: fixed` (or — after exhausting the 7-iteration ladder per finding, with research passes and model escalation sonnet → opus — gets logged to `receivingCodeReview.unrecovered[]` AND the repo's tech-debt doc).

Skipping `RECEIVING_CODE_REVIEW` entirely when `codeReview.findings[]` is non-empty is a contract violation. When findings are empty, the skill still writes a synthetic step (`dispatches: []`) so retro-analysis sees a uniform graph.

### Phase 6 — Write tests + mutation testing

`Skill(skill: "write-tests", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Authors green tests for the final post-fix file set AND runs mutation testing (Stryker / mutmut / go-mutesting) to verify each test catches at least one plausible mutation. This phase runs AFTER `receiving-code-review` so tests cover the final state of the code, not an interim revision that the fix loop will overwrite.

Skipped automatically when the repo carries no test setup — `write-tests`'s detector returns `hasTestSetup: false` and the step is recorded as `SKIPPED` with `applicability.reason: "no test setup detected"`.

### Phase 7 — Update docs

`Skill(skill: "update-docs", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Uses `browzer mentions` + direct-ref + concept-level signals. Writes `STEP_<NN>_UPDATE_DOCS`.

### Phase 8 — Feature acceptance

`Skill(skill: "feature-acceptance", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Always prompts autonomous/manual/hybrid (regardless of `config.mode`). Verifies PRD AC / NFR / metrics. Three terminal verdicts (per schema):

- `COMPLETED` — all checks verified, no deferred-post-merge actions outstanding. Chain to commit.
- `PAUSED_PENDING_OPERATOR` — automated checks all passed, but `operatorActionsRequested[]` carries unresolved `kind: "deferred-post-merge"` entries (staging soak, deploy-time observation, manual smoke). The orchestrator STILL chains to commit — the deferrals are honest, not failures — and emits the success line with a `; ⚠ <N> deferred-post-merge actions pending` suffix so the cursor reflects reality.
- `STOPPED` — at least one AC/NFR/metric genuinely failed. Stop the chain; hint back to `receiving-code-review` (re-entry to apply more fixes) or `execute-task`.

### Phase 9 — Commit

`Skill(skill: "commit", args: "feat dir: $FEAT_DIR")`. Writes `STEP_<NN>_COMMIT` with the SHA. In review mode, `commit` renders `commit.jq` and loops on operator edits before firing the git commit.

---

## Step 4 — Validate skill output

After every `Skill(...)` tool_result, read the just-written step via jq:

```bash
LAST=$(jq -r '.currentStepId' "$WORKFLOW")
STATUS=$(jq -r --arg id "$LAST" '.steps[] | select(.stepId==$id) | .status' "$WORKFLOW")
```

- `COMPLETED` → chain to the next phase.
- `AWAITING_REVIEW` → review mode is driving; the skill's internal loop is running. Wait for the skill to return a final status.
- `PAUSED_PENDING_OPERATOR` → only valid for `feature-acceptance`. Chain to commit; surface the deferred-action count in the cursor line. Do NOT stop the pipeline — the operator owes follow-up but the feature can ship.
- `STOPPED` → stop the chain; emit stop line + hint.
- `SKIPPED` → chain to the next phase.

Also validate the payload schema matches `references/workflow-schema.md` §4 for the step's `name`. If the payload is malformed (missing required keys), append `globalWarnings[]` and re-dispatch once; on second failure, STOP.

For any new mutation in this orchestrator (or for future skills you author), prefer `browzer workflow *` subcommands over rolling another inline pipeline — `append-step`, `complete-step`, `append-review-history`, `set-status`, and `patch` are the sanctioned shapes and they enforce the contracts (advisory lock, atomic rename, regression-diff diffing, completed-count integrity) uniformly across the pipeline. The helpers in `references/jq-helpers.sh` remain available for complex cross-step jq reads but should not be used for writes.

---

## Step 5 — Parallel dispatch (worktree rendezvous)

When `tasksManifest.parallelizable[][]` fires (and meets the heuristic above), or `receiving-code-review` dispatches across disjoint-file groups, follow the four-step claim → isolate → merge → freeze protocol documented in `references/worktree-rendezvous.md`:

1. Pre-dispatch claim — main worktree marks each step's `owner` and flips `status: "RUNNING"`.
2. In-worktree — each subagent operates only on steps it owns; never touches another worktree's slice.
3. Rendezvous — main worktree patches each owned step back via `jq | mv` (replacement, not merge).
4. Completed steps are immutable — re-runs require an explicit `retryCount` bump.

The full snippets, owner-string conventions, and failure-mode table live in [`references/worktree-rendezvous.md`](references/worktree-rendezvous.md). Read that file when actually firing a parallel dispatch — sequential flows skip this entirely.

---

## Step 6 — Stop conditions

Stop the chain (emit stop line) when any of these fire:

- **3-strike external failure**: a non-skill tool (git, pnpm, browzer CLI) fails 3 times for the same reason.
- **Feature-acceptance verdict STOPPED**: one or more AC/NFR/metrics failed. Hint to `receiving-code-review` re-entry (when the failure is a finding-class problem) or `execute-task` remediation (when it requires new code).
- **Operator abort**: operator replies with "stop" / "abort" / "cancel" to any gate prompt.
- **Schema corruption**: `jq empty "$WORKFLOW"` fails, or a step's payload fails schema §4 shape check twice.

Stop line shape:

```
orchestrate-task-delivery: stopped at <stepId> — <one-line cause>
hint: <single actionable next step>
```

---

## Step 7 — Completion

On success (all 9 phases COMPLETED), backfill the elapsed-time fields BEFORE printing the success line. The per-step `.elapsedMin` and the top-level `.totalElapsedMin` exist in the schema but no upstream skill is required to populate them — the orchestrator owns the roll-up so the audit trail captures wall-time per phase plus the end-to-end total.

```bash
browzer workflow patch --workflow "$WORKFLOW" --jq '
  ((.startedAt | fromdateiso8601) as $start
   | (.updatedAt | fromdateiso8601) as $end
   | .totalElapsedMin = (($end - $start) / 60 | floor))
  | .steps |= map(
      if (.startedAt and .completedAt) then
        ((.startedAt | fromdateiso8601) as $s
         | (.completedAt | fromdateiso8601) as $e
         | .elapsedMin = (($e - $s) / 60 | floor))
      else . end)'
```

Then print the success line:

```
orchestrate-task-delivery: completed <featureId> in <elapsedMin>m; commit <SHA>
```

Compute `<elapsedMin>` as the freshly-written `.totalElapsedMin`. Extract `<SHA>` from the COMMIT step's `commit.sha`.

**Banned from chat output**: phase-by-phase summaries, tasks tables, HANDOFF quotes, subagent transcripts, "Next steps" block. All of that lives in `workflow.json`.

---

## Mode-specific chain contract

### autonomous (`config.mode == "autonomous"`)

- No pauses between skills.
- No `.md` rendered.
- Skills chain directly — NO operator confirmation between phases (no "prossiga" / "continue" gate).
- Code-review's dispatch+tier prompts are skipped because the orchestrator pre-registers them in Phase 4 args.
- Feature-acceptance's mode prompt still fires (it's a financial-cost-vs-trust decision the operator owns at acceptance time, distinct from the flow-level mode).
- The autonomous contract MUST NOT be downgraded by inferring intent from continuation words; if a skill needs an explicit answer, it MUST ask via `AskUserQuestion`, not from chat heuristics.

### review (`config.mode == "review"`)

- Each review-candidate skill (§7.3 of the spec: brainstorming, generate-prd, generate-task, update-docs, commit; hybrid: code-review, feature-acceptance) flips its step to `AWAITING_REVIEW`, renders its `.jq` template, enters its internal gate loop.
- The skill returns COMPLETED only after operator approval. The orchestrator does NOT drive the review loop itself — each skill owns its gate.
- Operator adjustments translate to jq ops on the step's payload. Appended to `reviewHistory[]`.

---

## Tool usage discipline

- **`workflow.json` mutation**: ALWAYS `browzer workflow *` CLI subcommands (or `browzer workflow patch --jq` for arbitrary mutations). NEVER `Read` / `Write` / `Edit` on `workflow.json`.
- **Parallel dispatch**: literal — N `Task(...)` or `Agent(...)` calls in a single response turn. Announcing "3 parallel agents" and sending 1 call is a protocol violation.
- **Subagent preamble**: paste `references/subagent-preamble.md` §Step 1-5 verbatim into every dispatched agent's prompt.
- **Browzer first**: before touching any library/framework/config you didn't author, run `browzer search` → then Context7 if browzer has no coverage.

---

## Non-negotiables

- **Output language: English.** All workflow.json fields in English. Conversational wrapper follows operator's language.
- No application code. You are the orchestrator.
- No silent skips of phases. If a phase is genuinely n/a (e.g. no TASK steps because the PRD is pure docs), the skipped step is recorded with `status: SKIPPED` and `applicability.applicable: false`.
- No inline gate-failure fixes. Dispatch a fix agent via `receiving-code-review`.
- No parallel edits of the same file without worktree isolation.
- `commit` is the last phase. Don't chain to `sync-workspace` — that's a separate ops concern.

---

## Invocation modes

- **Direct feature request** — operator says "add X", "implement Y", "build Z". Route through Step 0 mode prompt → Phase 0/1/2/… in order.
- **Mid-flow entry** — operator says "execute TASK_03", "update the docs", "commit what I staged". Resolve `FEAT_DIR` from context, jump to the named phase. Inherit `config.mode` from workflow.json.
- **Quality-only rerun** — operator says "re-run code-review after iteration". Invoke the named phase standalone; each skill re-enters and writes a new step (with a new NN index).

---

## Related skills and references

- `brainstorming`, `generate-prd`, `generate-task`, `execute-task`, `code-review`, `receiving-code-review`, `write-tests`, `update-docs`, `feature-acceptance`, `commit` — the pipeline.
- `references/workflow-schema.md` — authoritative schema. READ FIRST before any jq filter.
- `references/subagent-preamble.md` — paste into every dispatched agent's prompt.
- `references/renderers/*.jq` — per-step markdown renderers invoked in review mode.
- `sync-workspace` — separate skill; re-indexes the workspace after merge. Not part of this pipeline.
