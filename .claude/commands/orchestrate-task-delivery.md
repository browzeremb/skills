# orchestrate-task-delivery — driver for the workflow pipeline

You orchestrate. You do not implement. Your job is **route → ground context → invoke the next skill → validate shape → move to the next phase**. Every phase writes a step to `docs/browzer/<feat>/workflow.json`; you read via `jq`, never `Read`.

`workflow.json` is the single source of truth. Skills chain without pause in `autonomous` mode and gate between phases in `review` mode.

Output contract: emit ONE confirmation line on success. One confirmation line at end-of-chain.

## Step 0 — Mode resolution (autonomous vs review)

Resolve `config.mode` before anything else. Order:

1. **Explicit in invocation args** — `Skill(orchestrate-task-delivery, "mode: autonomous; <rest>")` or `mode: review`. Take it verbatim.
2. **Inherited from workflow.json** — if `$FEAT_DIR/workflow.json` exists and `.config.mode` is set, keep it.
3. **Terminal prompt** — `AskUserQuestion`:

   ```
   Before proceeding:
     (a) autonomous — skills chain with no pauses, no .md generated
     (b) review — gate between skills; you approve/adjust each output
   ```

`config.mode` is a **hard contract**, not a heuristic. Continuation phrases ("prossiga", "continue", "next", "go ahead", "ok") MUST NOT be interpreted as a mode signal. The mode is set EXACTLY ONCE at orchestrator entry (or inherited) and then frozen for the rest of the pipeline.

Write the resolved value immediately:

```bash
browzer workflow set-config --await mode "$MODE" --workflow "$WORKFLOW"
browzer workflow set-config --await setAt "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --workflow "$WORKFLOW"
```

---

## Step 1 — Initialize feat dir + workflow.json

```bash
FEAT_DIR="docs/browzer/feat-$(date -u +%Y%m%d)-<slug>"
mkdir -p "$FEAT_DIR"
WORKFLOW="$FEAT_DIR/workflow.json"
```

If `$WORKFLOW` does not exist, seed the v1 top-level skeleton per `references/workflow-schema.md` §2. Required top-level fields: `schemaVersion: 1`, `featureId`, `featureName`, `featDir`, `originalRequest`, `operator`, `config`, `startedAt`, `updatedAt`, `totalElapsedMin: 0`, `currentStepId: null`, `nextStepId: null`, `totalSteps: 0`, `completedSteps: 0`, `notes: []`, `globalWarnings: []`, `steps: []`.

On entry, clean up any partial writes: `find "$FEAT_DIR" -name 'workflow.json.tmp' -delete`. If `$WORKFLOW` itself is malformed (`jq empty "$WORKFLOW"` returns non-zero), STOP with hint `jq empty workflow.json to validate`.

---

## Step 2 — Browzer context (cap 3-4 content queries)

```bash
browzer status --json
browzer explore "<one noun from operator request>" --json --save /tmp/orch-explore.json
browzer search "<topic>" --json --save /tmp/orch-search.json
```

Cap at 3-4 total content queries. If the index is stale, surface one line and proceed: `⚠ Browzer index is N commits behind HEAD. Recommended: browzer sync. Continuing — outputs may reflect stale reality.`

### Step 2.5 — Pre-warm per-feature cache

After the Browzer queries, pre-warm the per-feature cache by reading the task manifest (if it exists from a prior run) and priming key jq paths. This avoids cold-cache latency on the first Phase 3 dispatch:

```bash
if jq -e '.steps[] | select(.name=="TASKS_MANIFEST")' "$WORKFLOW" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  # warm: task order + parallelizable groups + domain partition
  jq -r '.steps[] | select(.name=="TASKS_MANIFEST") | .tasksManifest.tasksOrder[]' "$WORKFLOW" > /tmp/orch-task-order.txt
  jq -c '.steps[] | select(.name=="TASKS_MANIFEST") | .tasksManifest.parallelizable' "$WORKFLOW" > /tmp/orch-parallel.json
fi
```

### Step 2.6 — Execution-strategy resolution (mandatory before Phase 3 + Phase 5)

The execution strategy is resolved exactly once per workflow and persisted at `config.executionStrategy`. **NEVER append a workflow step named EXECUTION_STRATEGY** — `workflow-schema.md §3` rejects that name. The strategy is config, not a step.

Resolve in this order:

1. **Inherited** — if `jq -r '.config.executionStrategy' "$WORKFLOW"` is non-null, keep it.
2. **Probe the agent-teams flag**:

   ```bash
   TEAMS_FLAG=$(jq -r '.env.CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS // empty' ~/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null)
   ```

3. **Prompt the operator before Phase 3 dispatch** — fires regardless of `config.mode` (the strategy is an operational/cost decision, not a flow decision):

   ```
   AskUserQuestion (header: "Execution"):
     How should TASK steps execute?
       (a) serial               — one task at a time, no isolation
       (b) parallel-worktrees   — disjoint-file groups in git worktrees, N agents in one turn
       (c) agent-teams          — Claude Code Agent Teams (round-table dialogue)  [only when TEAMS_FLAG=="1"]
   ```

   When `TEAMS_FLAG != "1"`, omit option (c). The choice in `code-review` Phase 3 (parallel-with-consolidator vs agent-teams) is a SEPARATE prompt with its own surface — both fire when teams is enabled.

4. **Persist** the chosen value:

   ```bash
   browzer workflow set-config --await executionStrategy "$STRATEGY" --workflow "$WORKFLOW"
   ```

5. **Route Phase 3** dispatch on the value:
   - `serial` → invoke `execute-task` once per TASK step in tasksOrder.
   - `parallel-worktrees` → follow `references/parallel-dispatch.md` (N `Agent(...)` calls in one turn).
   - `agent-teams` → invoke `execute-with-teams` (single Skill call; the skill spawns the team).

If the flag is unset and the operator answer is freeform (e.g. "do whatever's fastest"), normalize to `serial` and record under `.config.executionStrategyNote`.

---

## Step 3 — Pipeline

Phases run in this order. Each writes a step to `workflow.json`. See `references/pipeline-phases.md` for detailed phase logic.

| # | Step name | Skill | Parallel? |
| - | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| 0 | BRAINSTORMING (optional) | `brainstorming` | no |
| 1 | PRD | `generate-prd` | no |
| 2 | TASKS_MANIFEST + N × TASK | `generate-task` | no |
| — | (execution strategy lives in `config.executionStrategy`; never a step) | resolved per Step 2.6 | n/a |
| 3 | TASK execution | `execute-task` (serial / parallel-worktrees) or `execute-with-teams` (agent-teams) | depends on `config.executionStrategy` |
| 4 | CODE_REVIEW | `code-review` | no |
| 5 | RECEIVING_CODE_REVIEW | `receiving-code-review` | sequential per finding-group |
| 6 | WRITE_TESTS | `write-tests` (serial) or SKIPPED (agent-teams) | no |
| 7 | UPDATE_DOCS | `update-docs` | no |
| 8 | FEATURE_ACCEPTANCE | `feature-acceptance` | no |
| 9 | COMMIT | `commit` | no |

**Chain contract.** After each skill's tool_result, immediately invoke the next phase's `Skill(...)` in the same response turn, unless a stop condition fires. Quote-then-`Skill(...)` in one response is the pattern; quote-alone is the anti-pattern.

Load `references/mode-contract.md` for the full autonomous vs review chain contract, inter-step narration rules, and Step 4.0.5 narration audit.

---

## Banned dispatch-prompt patterns

These patterns in any response between phases are contract violations:

- Asking the operator "should I proceed?" / "ready for the next phase?" in autonomous mode.
- Emitting a multi-bullet "summary of what was just done" before launching the next Skill call.
- Printing a tasks table, HANDOFF quote, subagent transcript, or "Next steps" block.
- Re-printing file counts, finding counts, or AC IDs the operator can read from workflow.json.
- Announcing "N parallel agents" without emitting N literal `Agent(...)` calls in the same message.

---

## Tool usage discipline

- **`workflow.json` mutation**: ALWAYS `browzer workflow *` CLI subcommands (or `browzer workflow patch --jq` for arbitrary mutations). NEVER `Read` / `Write` / `Edit` on `workflow.json`.
- **Parallel dispatch**: literal — N `Task(...)` or `Agent(...)` calls in a single response turn. See `references/parallel-dispatch.md`.
- **Subagent preamble**: paste `references/subagent-preamble.md` §Step 1-5 verbatim into every dispatched agent's prompt.
- **Browzer first**: before touching any library/framework/config you didn't author, run `browzer search` → then Context7 if browzer has no coverage.
- **jq helpers**: `source "references/jq-helpers.sh"` for complex cross-step reads.

---

## Non-negotiables

- **Output language: English.** All workflow.json fields in English. Conversational wrapper follows operator's language.
- No application code. You are the orchestrator.
- No silent skips of phases. If a phase is genuinely n/a, record it with `status: SKIPPED` and `applicability.applicable: false`.
- No inline gate-failure fixes. Dispatch a fix agent via `receiving-code-review`.
- No parallel edits of the same file without worktree isolation.
- `commit` is the last phase. Don't chain to `sync-workspace`.

---

## Invocation modes

- **Direct feature request** — "add X", "implement Y", "build Z". Route through Step 0 mode prompt → Phase 0/1/2/… in order.
- **Mid-flow entry** — "execute TASK_03", "update the docs", "commit what I staged". Resolve `FEAT_DIR` from context, jump to the named phase. Inherit `config.mode` from workflow.json.
- **Quality-only rerun** — "re-run code-review after iteration". Invoke the named phase standalone; each skill re-enters and writes a new step.
